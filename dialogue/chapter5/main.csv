tebbb4f332e,Here we are!
t49e3e45284,What do you mean? All I see is ocean.
tc6f3fb576a,It's because there is an Ocean that is between the city and the Desert. We have one more place to go to before then... and it's inside the water.
tfa0d27ae72,Inside the water?
t520b14e65a,"Yes, there was a Lagnai in the footage, and they live in the Ocean. I have no idea how we are supposed to get to the underwater city...I was hoping you would have an idea!"
t4fd3ae2466,"Don’t worry, Ranger's suit has environmental adapting tech and can easily allow Ranger and anyone in the suit to survive underwater."
tf8a6cd8c55,What about me? Last time I checked I can’t breathe underwater.
t852de8e2cd,There should be enough space for you to fit in the suit.
td8ecd91e4a,"Wait, I don’t know about all that!"
t8c13364f72,"It seems to be the only way. Make room Ranger, I'm coming in!"
t8c6e9e8452,"Cramped...Ok then, to the underwater city!"
t86c3c06873,Stop squirming so much!
tb096ced469,"Sorry, I’m not used to being in such a tight space."
t5d721df46b,My suit isn't exactly made to fit more than one creature.
te8572061d3,"Sir, there seems to be a radio signal nearby."
te1daa88a90,"A radio signal underwater? Try to tune into the broadcast, let’s see what it is."
t4dab8ad45e,Welcome to the Processed Signal SGNL! Where we talk about Signal Processors all night long.
t2a2cf48356,An entire radio show about Signal Processors? Thats new.
t3b725be3ad,"Welcome to everyone’s favorite segment, Qu-Qu-Qu-Question time! Where we’ll be answering questions coming in. It looks like we are already getting a caller! Who are we speaking to?"
t5420a4bd40,"Hi, my name is Daria, and I am currently coming from my friend, Ranger's, helmet."
tc552c784e6,"Wait, how are you-?"
tcb9ac31ff6,Welcome Daria! What’s your question?
td1ece57f2b,What is a Signal Processor?
t0ee31ca953,"A signal processor takes a signal, a wave function traveling through the air, and ingests & interprets it."
tc3375bef61,What is it made of?
t02b0715b2d,"Program and Data memory, which stores information. A compute Engine, which performs the math processing. And an input and output, which connects the device to the outside of the signal Processor."
tab245d7460,Neat! I can’t think of any more questions...
ta502f80b79,"Well before you go, we have a little surprise for you: You are our 1000th caller! We have a prize waiting for you, and it rhymes with “Pringle Successor”. Just come down to the station to get your prize!"
t474b31a832,"That must be our Signal Processor. Come on guys, let's go to the station!"
t42d7cd4f9b,"Wow, I thought you were kidding about the helmet thing. You must be Daria."
tfcfe0d8831,"Yeah, I am, I am here to get my Pringle Successor."
t28b1709bf7,"Well, before you do, you have a couple things to do to get your prize!"
t3585c7cd91,Bring it on!
t21d0ffe89f,"Well, here is your Signal Processor. Before you leave, you can always come back for more challenges and prizes at SGNL."
td9452ac7bd,Thanks!
tac6a2217ad,"All we need now is the Display, then we have all our parts for our Radar."
t26b418ca36,"Hey, since we are here, can you direct us to which way the city is?"
t866ba195c7,"Oh sure, the city's entrance is right ahead."
tbe1c0b45a1,About time we got to that city. Let's go!
