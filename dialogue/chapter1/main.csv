t44fc75551b,"Don’t interrupt me! It’s not broken, it’s completely missing. Sir, this is not good."
tddf5b00135,"Missing? Unless it fell out of the ship during the crash, it must have been stolen...Check the CCTV footage, quickly."
t39e146ed2d,"I tried doing that during my diagnostics, but I couldn’t access it. It seems like somebody is messing with my system in the main bay. Let me open the door and you go check it out."

t54e55888c6,HEY! I am not a thing; I am a Daran!

taa65c82d6f,How does a radar detect things?
t88abf908ea,Asks politely
td2d279eb6e,Studies very hard
"The radar transmits a pulse wave – usually shortwave 
 microwaves – at a certain time.","The radar transmits a pulse wave – usually shortwave 
 microwaves – at a certain time."
te49cdcb7ac,Uses the MBSE model
t123edd5699,What does the pulse wave do?
tda308a5274,Finishes your math homework
t8b9eac592c,The pulse travels through Jello and bounces off a spoon
tf0462cc0c0,Makes you act on impulse
"The pulse travels through a medium (air, vacuum of space) 
 and bounces off an object.","The pulse travels through a medium (air, vacuum of space) 
 and bounces off an object."
t5b960bb877,Why does it bounce off an object?
t88213c60a1,"Once it bounces off the object, it comes back towards the radar."
t7efbf0b560,It wants to be a gymnast
t81e0d9731e,It wants to see how high it can jump
t3ac8c6ee93,It’s coated in bouncy juice
t95e74d146d,How does the radar know where the object is?
t6d59b9afe0,It looks at it with binoculars
"It finds the range by measuring the time the pulse was sent & 
 when the pulse returns & 
 divides it by 2","It finds the range by measuring the time the pulse was sent & 
 when the pulse returns & 
 divides it by 2"
tcd7eb62156,It tries it’s best
t2b55699fad,It communicates with other radars within a 300-mile radius
td97c1ea399,What if the object is moving?
te655873ceb,It puts pedal to the metal
tda4d26f57b,"It says, “SLOW DOWN!”"
"We can determine the direction & speed the object is moving by 
 looking at various positions over time","We can determine the direction & speed the object is moving by 
 looking at various positions over time"
td7665734c1,It does not detect the object
tb9d56cc107,"That sounds awesome, what does a Radar look like?"
td4eaa52908,"What are you talking about, don’t you not have my radar? What were you doing on my ship?"
tc75bb9b9b9,"I heard an explosion and wanted to see what was going on. When I got here, I saw your friends running off, so I assumed everyone was gone."
t76cdc77037,"Friends? Unless ROGER grew some legs and ran off, no one else was on the ship but us two."
t73fee68bbd,"What about the Scein? And the Trolum? Or the Yappo? The Tendra? And the...what were they called? Oh yeah, the Lagna!"
t1cdab008fc,"Sheiza, the aliens of this planet must have gotten on board while ROGER and I were out cold..."
tae380d9e41,"Ranger, while you were playing catch up with your new friend, I got access to the CCTV footage. You should come take a look at this; I will be waiting in the Comms room."
tf1684095e0,"According to the video, it looks like there were 5 different aliens that took parts of the Radar."
t1bafa24ade,"Ok ROGER, is there any way you can track them down?"
te43d75db1f,"Sadly I cannot. Due to my reboot, most of my functionality was wiped clean."
tbba8c438c2,"Dango! First my ship crashes, then my radar is stolen, and now ROGER? How am I going to get this done?"
t3c06e11e88,Perhaps I can help!
t10e94eb338,Oh yeah? Why would you help us! I don’t even know your name...
t607f0b2f98,"The name is Daria! I am a Daran, the native species of Hertzich! I had so much fun with you earlier, I thought I would see if you wanted to play more!"
tec0eb4c5b0,And why should I trust you?
t35c54c8034,Do you have any other options?
t6784b5943a,"Dango, you gotta point there...Alright, and how exactly can you help?"
t71c8e1bb89,"I’ve lived here all my life and I know this planet like the back of my paw. The big city, Yaplisdapolis, would have somewhere to fix your ship. I can show you how to get there!"
td197291984,"The city? I saw that earlier when we were falling into the atmosphere, I don’t think it’s too far...but what about the missing radar? I would be flying blind in deep space without it!"
t9b3a08870b,"Well, all the nice people I saw earlier had pieces of something, I bet that was your missing radar! I know a path that would lead into each major village of the other species on the planet, with the biiiiiig city at the end!"
t91353689b3,"Well, it seems we really could use your help then...Ok hotshot, where to first?"
t046e4ae97f,The closest village would be in the Plains of Trolonc. That’s where the Trolums live. I bet we can find a part of your radar there!
t30743222f8,"Sounds good! ROGER, will you be ok on the ship?"
t1c8dbe3e55,"Don’t worry Ranger, I have a piece of me in your suit, it will be like I never left your side. Gotta make sure you stay on track."
