Daria: Sorry to bother you, but have you seen anyone with a weird device?

Trolum: [#type = trolum3] Well, Travin just came by saying that they found this weird Geode while scavenging. It was a square rock with these weird items on the right and a transparent rock on the left. 

Ranger: That must be the Control Unit! Where is Travin right now?
Trolum: [#type = trolum3] He runs a shop next door. It's hard to miss.

Travin: OH, you're talking about my Geode. It looks beautiful, I would show you, but it's not for sale.
Ranger: Actually, that geode you're talking about is a control unit for my radar, and its mine!
