~ chapter2_NPC_3
Daria: Excuse me Sir, has anything unusual happened today?
NPC: I think Travin just came by stating that they found this weird Geode looking rock while scavenging. It was a square rock with these weird items on the right and a transparent rock on the left. He should be in his little shop nearby.
Ranger: That must be the Control Unit! Where is this Travin right now?
NPC: He runs a shop down at the end. It's hard to miss.

Travin: Welcome to the shop... oh some newcomers. I am Travin and this is my shop.
Daria: Hey there sir, we heard from somebody that you found something recently? 
Travin: OH, you're talking about my Geode. It looks beautiful, I would show you, but its something I would want to keep. 
Ranger:  Actually, we are here to grab that Geode. It is ours.
