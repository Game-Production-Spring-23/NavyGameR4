t41f324b156,I heard a loud bang earlier; I think it was just the neighbors
t383544819b,"Sorry to bother you, but have you seen anyone with a weird device?"
tb55b87b074,"Well, Travin just came by saying that they found this weird Geode while scavenging. It was a square rock with these weird items on the right and a transparent rock on the left."
te0a7cc9cf9,That must be the Control Unit! Where is Travin right now?
tf142fb31bc,He runs a shop next door. It's hard to miss.
t7254bb4e0e,Newcomers...Welcome in! I am Travin and this is my shop.
tf9175e8dd6,"Hey there sir, we heard from somebody that you found some cool geode recently?"
t0b52c820db,"OH, you're talking about my Geode. It looks beautiful, I would show you, but it's not for sale."
t2372788ad5,"Actually, that geode you're talking about is a control unit for my radar, and its mine!"
