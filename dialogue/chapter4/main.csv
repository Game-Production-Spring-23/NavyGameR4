t3a6da96713,That was so fun!
tb30f115b6b,"Not going to lie, it was a little fun. So where are we now exactly?"
t58e99f6095,"This right here is the Deserts of Sceivnarter. Home of the Scein. On the footage, there was a Scein that took a part. There's an oasis town nearby that should have some information on the part."
tbc72bdedd0,"Alright, Lead the way!"
tf2729444a6,"Alright, you know the drill. Let's talk to the Natives around here for information."
t05842ef386,Make sure you watch your amplitude!
t8ce26abf1d,What's an amplitude?
tb1b448b8d4,It refers to the electromagnetic wave that relates to the energy of said wave.
t765218b69d,Uh…sure
t998f938e62,Keeping track of your wavelength could save your life!
tec62c87a25,What's a wavelength?
t1cf50a3d48,It’s the distance between two consecutive points on a wave that are in phase with each other.
ta12f9eaa62,Huh?
t849f9b1cab,The frequency at which you move is vital…
tb1d819cae0,What's frequency?
t7bf59bca2d,The frequency is the number of cycles a wave in one second.
tc67865b058,That’s not what I was talking about!
td1fe336444,Stop for a period and rest…
t8f316420fa,"Period, like at the end of a sentence?"
t74528e67ad,Period is the time it takes for the wave to go through one cycle.
t96ae019a3a,Sounds complicated…
tdb412b4bea,I move with the velocity of jets!
t3f2bb3a06d,Velo-city? Where is that?
tb73d051380,"It's not a place, It’s the speed at which the wave moves through a given medium."
t89c68ddf58,I guess???
t91b5e60efb,"Did you know that in a perfect vacuum, the speed of any electromagnetic wave is equal to the speed of light, c=3x10^8 ms? This only can happen in a perfect vacuum, its slower anywhere else!"
tce021c6b96,What?
t7ca16a6f6d,"I... got nothing else to add here, you know your stuff!"
te9ee25942d,No Problem?
t404c09a70a,"If you need locks, I’m your guy! Just made this new safe with some extraterrestrial ship parts!"
t11db46fbf6,Thats our transceiver!
t31d444062b,"Oh yeah? Prove it! If you can unlock my new safe, then I'll give it to you!"
t50b432322e,"Guess we don’t have a choice, hand it over!"
t026b820ef2,"You guys are master lockpickers! Here is your transceiver thingy back, I already copied down the design anyway."
t8d0265e2df,Thanks!
teb066576a8,"Alright, we got another part! Now to the next area!"
tc2243ced3b,I hope we are getting close...
t8af782b938,And I hope you can swim!
td2d25a9e64,What Three Properties affect waves?
t5d181a53f6,"Amplitude, Frequency, and Wavelength"
t82797a8a7f,Correct!
t44a8249f72,"Velocity, Impulse, and Flash"
ta3fe43bf26,"Incorrect, please try again"

t1811dc7c09,"Incorrect, please try again"
t8d19140274,What is Velocity?
tdbf00c20a9,The speed at which the wave moves through a given medium
t5f5f282d8f,Correct!
t64c001666b,the time it takes for the wave to go through one cycle
t160386111a,"Incorrect, please try again"
te4d7091160,It’s the distance between two consecutive points on a wave.
tdde770a772,"Incorrect, please try again"
t07de36bc74,How do electromagnetic waves differ from other kinds of waves?
tabec72dd6a,"They have frequency, amplitude, and a wavelength"
tc90d707707,"Incorrect, please try again"
te4f8e82275,They are completely similar to other kinds of waves
tb3c19bb864,"Incorrect, please try again"
t934a9fcbad,They don’t need a material medium to travel.
t7707bba1af,Correct!
